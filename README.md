# Introduction

Welcome to the DLRGeoTweet project! This repository contains the dataset for the paper "DLRGeoTweet: A Comprehensive Social Media Geocoding Corpus Featuring Fine-Grained Places." The dataset includes five sub-datasets with approximately 7,000 tweets and 12,000 places from around the world, encompassing 6,000 fine-grained locations.

The screenshot of the corpus is as follows:

Please note that for some tweets, the ID is missing. In these cases, we have synthesized an ID, such as '200000002'.
